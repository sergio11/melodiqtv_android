# MelodiqTV 🎶✨: Unleash the Power of Music on Your TV

<img width="auto" height="300px" align="left" src="doc/melodiq_logo.jpg" />

**MelodiqTV** is a personal project I created to explore and learn about Android TV development, focusing on music streaming and UI/UX design. This app serves as a prototype for a music and video streaming platform, built entirely with resources for testing and experimentation. My goal with **MelodiqTV** is to dive deeper into Android TV development and get hands-on experience with the platform.

I used **Firebase 🔥** for real-time data synchronization and secure authentication to enhance the app's functionality. The project follows **Clean Architecture** and the **MVI pattern 🏛️**, which allows me to maintain a scalable and maintainable codebase as I continue to improve my development skills.

The user interface is crafted with **Jetpack Compose for TV 📺**, ensuring a modern and flexible design. I also integrated **[🍮 Fudge](https://github.com/sergio11/fudge_tv_compose_library)**, a UI kit for TV apps, to improve navigation and create a more polished experience on large screens.

A huge thank you to the creators of **[JetFit](https://github.com/TheChance101/tv-samples/tree/JetFit/JetFit)** and the contributors to **[PR #183](https://github.com/android/tv-samples/pull/183)** for providing an invaluable foundation for **MelodiqTV**. This is an attempt to provide an open-source implementation of JetFit. Licensed under **Apache 2.0** (implementation) and **CC BY 4.0** (design), JetFit served as a key reference for building a seamless **Jetpack Compose for TV** experience. I encourage you to visit the PR, review the effort, and give the deserved recognition. For more details and attributions, please check the **"Credits"** section below. 🚀

This app, **MelodiqTV**, includes images and resources designed by [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com). We would like to acknowledge and thank Freepik for their incredible design assets. The images used in the app are provided with attribution, as required by Freepik's licensing terms. For more information on Freepik's resources, please visit [www.freepik.com](https://www.freepik.com).

For the purpose of this project, I have used a free demonstration video sourced from **Mixkit**. The video showcases a young girl dancing and serves as an example to demonstrate the app's features in action.

## Overview 🌐

**MelodiqTV** is a personal project I’ve developed as part of my exploration into Android TV app development. It’s not a fully-fledged music streaming service, but rather an experiment to learn how to create a music and video platform for the TV environment.

Here’s a look at what I’ve been working on so far:

<p align="center">
  <img src="doc/screenshots/picture_48.gif" />
</p>

### Personalized Profiles 👥
One of the features I’ve integrated is personalized profiles, where users (or family members) can create their own profiles. This allows for saving favorites and experimenting with music recommendations, giving each profile a unique experience. It’s been a fun way to dive into user data management and customization.

<p align="center">
  <img src="doc/screenshots/picture_49.gif" />
</p>

### Advanced Music Search 🔍
As part of my learning process, I’ve implemented an advanced search feature that allows users to filter songs by different criteria:
- **Genre** 🎵: Explore different music genres.
- **Mood** 😊: Find music that matches your current mood.
- **Language** 🌍: Select tracks in your preferred language.
- **Release Date** 📅: Discover the latest releases or timeless classics.

<p align="center">
  <img src="doc/screenshots/picture_50.gif" />
</p>

### Customizable Preferences ⚙️
For further customization, MelodiqTV allows for personalized settings, including:
- **Default Video Quality** 📺: Set your preferred resolution for music videos.
- **App Language** 🌐: Choose the app’s language.
- **Playback Options** 🎧: Adjust playback settings for a tailored experience.

These settings are part of my ongoing learning process in user experience design and how to create a more personalized and enjoyable app experience.

- **Mapper Pattern**: 🔄 Facilitates conversion between different data models, ensuring data consistency across application components. 📐

## Architecture Overview 🏛️

Our application is designed with a robust architecture for maintainability, testability, and flexibility. The architecture leverages several design patterns and principles:

### **Clean Architecture** 🏗️
Clean Architecture focuses on separating concerns into distinct layers:
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles UI and user interactions using Jetpack Compose for modern interfaces.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and use cases, independent of external frameworks.
- **Data Layer**: Manages data sources and repositories, abstracting data retrieval and storage.

### **Data Sources** 📦
Data sources fetch and manage data from various origins, including:
- **Remote Data Sources**: Interact with cloud services or web APIs (e.g., Firebase Firestore).
- **Local Data Sources**: Handle local data storage (e.g., Jetpack DataStore).

### **Repository Pattern** 🗃️
The repository pattern provides a unified interface for data access, decoupling data retrieval from the rest of the application for easier testing and maintenance.

### **Use Cases** 🧩
In the Domain Layer, Use Cases represent specific actions, encapsulating business logic and interacting with repositories to retrieve or modify data.

### **Inversion of Control (IoC)** 🔄
IoC inverts control flow, allowing dependencies to be injected rather than hardcoded, promoting modularity and reducing boilerplate code.

### **SOLID Principles** 📏
We apply SOLID principles to ensure our codebase remains clean and maintainable:
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class has one responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes are open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules depend on abstractions.

### **MVI (Model-View-Intent)** 📈
MVI manages state and interactions, ensuring a predictable unidirectional data flow.

This architecture ensures that MelodiqTV is well-structured, easy to maintain, and scalable, adhering to best practices and design principles.

**MelodiqTV does not provide any music streaming content, licenses, or music programs.** Instead, it serves as a **demonstration project** showcasing how to design and develop TV-based music and video applications. The UI, navigation, and functionalities are implemented to simulate a real-world music streaming app experience.

Additionally, the name **"MelodiqTV"** was generated during a **brainstorming session with AI**, and any resemblance to existing brands or services is purely **coincidental**.

The **logo of MelodiqTV** was **generated by ChatGPT** and is **free of copyright restrictions**. It is provided exclusively for **demonstration and educational purposes** and does not represent an actual brand or commercial entity.  

This repository is intended solely for **learning, experimentation, and non-commercial purposes**. If you wish to develop a real music streaming service, please ensure compliance with content licensing, intellectual property, and relevant regulations.
